polyHIPE-Diffusion

This project was made to model the Brownian motion and diffusion of a tracer 
particle and geometrically simplified polyHIPE system. Original work was done 
using a series of MATLAB programs using GUI, until all modeling was converted 
into script-like files that could be ran efficiently on a HPC (High Performance
Computing Cluster). 

This section of coding  was done while I was in a research group at Case 
Western Reserve University in conjuction with Proctor & Gamble. Since research
agreements are sticky business, I am going to air on the side of caution and
not apply any license to that code, although I may post it at a later date.

I am currently reworking this project into a fully fledged simulation program
written in java. Check the java branch for further updates and current code.

Cheers,
nerd
