**DESCRIPTION**
This is a hodgepodge collection of all the source files I've written in MATLAB
for the polyHIPE-diffusion project. Some snippets have been taken and modified 
from wikis and stack overflow, and the progressbar is from the MATLAB community.

Not all files are executable by themselves.
